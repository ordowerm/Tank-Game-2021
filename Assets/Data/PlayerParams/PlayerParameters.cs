     * Controller lock on is accomplished by casting rays from a player's gun to all enemies on screen.
     * It then sorts the enemies, using a heuristic function approximating the best enemy to aim at first.
     * The "score" from the heuristic considers enemy distance from player + how far away the enemy is from the player's aiming angle.
     * The degree to which these two variables are weighted are defined in these player parameters.
     * 
     * maxAngleError -> this value determines the maximum angle error, between the angle the player's gun is facing and a given enemy position, before the game says, "You can't lock onto that enemy."
     * lockOnCancelTime-> if the lock-on button is released and then tapped again within lockOnCancelTime seconds, then instead of cancelling the lock-on, the focus will advance to the next-closest enemy
     *
     * The aiming heuristic weights are used when determining the priorities of which enemies to lock onto.
